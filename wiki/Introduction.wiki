= Introduction =
This is a set of metrics based on RMS error which indicate the overall performance of a model to simulate the cloud radiative effects (CREs) of cloud regimes in annual mean climatology as well as in natural variations. The cloud regimes are defined as grid-boxes sharing similar daily mean cloud top pressures, optical depths and cloud covers from the ISCCP data.

== Cloud Regime Error Metric for annual mean climatology ==

This is a single scalar metric for the annual mean climatology of net CRE, a CREM for the present day (CREMpd). It is RMS error (RMSE) of Net CRE and can be broken down into two components of errors for each regimes; the error from the relative frequency of occurrence (RFO) and the error from Net CRE when the regime occurs (NCRE).

Improvements are seen in mainly in the radiative properties of optically thicker low and high topped cloud regimes rather than frequency of occurrence.[[http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-012-1609-4 Tsushima et al.,2012]]
